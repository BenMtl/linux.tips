# Intro
`gnome-disks` utility (gnome 3.1x.x and above) is resposable of dealing with automounting and disk management.
Even if automount feature is disabled this utility might override it because it deals with udev directly, that's why you need
to inspect it if you're still having a remote disk mounted

Open `gnome-disks` and configure it accordingly
