When using Alt/Option/Meta key on OS/X you're probably fine with it but with iTerm2 terminal you might have troubles with nano.
When multibuffer is enabled and you need to switch between files (ALT+., ALT+,) it's easy on Linux but unfortunately it does
not work on Mac OS/X. 

### Solution
```
- GoTo iTerm2/Preferences/Profiles
- Tab Keys
- "Left (Meta) Key"  radio button below the key mappings list. Select [ESC+] (default is [normal])
```
And you're set
