### `gitub push` error on command line after enabling 2FA auth
I was expecting some kind of error on command line after enabling 2 Factor Authentication (2FA) because `git push` doesn't care about it. Official github guide on this topic is reported as:
(https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line).
This solution suggests using access tokens as preferred way to solve it, sounds nice and easy to me.
